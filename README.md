 Within the large world of proteomics, protein mutations have surfaced as a point of
 interest in protein research. As a single protein can have up to tenfold variants of
 mutations, there is a need to characterize these mutants effectively. To solve this
 problem, computational methods can be combined with the availability of publicly
 available online datasets. By utilizing supervised machine learning methods, the
 stability of proteins can be estimated by predicting their class of free binding en
ergy (∆∆G). This approach allows for a lightweight classification of mutant protein
 stability from models trained on real experimental data. Models were trained on a
 dataset taken from FireProtDB, containing rich profiling of each protein mutation
 sequence from a combination of experimental and computed properties. Compar
isons of different training and testing strategies and attention to model parameters
 were also conducted to achieve better performance of every model. This study also
 evaluates the performance of these machine learning models under several evalua
tion metrics, prioritizing the handling of imbalanced data. With nine classification
 models used in this study, we demonstrate a simple pipeline to produce up to 85%
 accuracy in classifying stability classes (destabilizing, neutral, and stabilizing) of
 mutations.
